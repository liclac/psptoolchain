# Make sure Type-B PSPs are mounted with Mode 0666 (world-writable).
# This removes the need to run `usbhostfs_pc` as root.
# 
# To install, copy this file to:
#     /etc/udev/rules.d/99-psplink.rules
# 
# Note: The filename is important; it must start with a number higher
# than 50, otherwise MODE changes will not take effect!
